Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using machine learning models. 

The dataset used for this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## GOAL OF THE PROJECT

build a predictive model that can accurately classify the quality of wine


### Features

The dataset contains 178 instances and 13 features. Each instance represents a wine sample, and the features represent various chemical properties of the wine. Below is a list of the features:

1. **Alcohol**: Alcohol content in the wine.
2. **Malic Acid**: Amount of malic acid.
3. **Ash**: Ash content in the wine.
4. **Alcalinity of Ash**: Alkalinity of ash.
5. **Magnesium**: Magnesium content in the wine.
6. **Total Phenols**: Total phenolic content.
7. **Flavanoids**: Flavonoid content.
8. **Nonflavanoid Phenols**: Non-flavonoid phenolic content.
9. **Proanthocyanins**: Proanthocyanin content.
10. **Color Intensity**: Intensity of the wine color.
11. **Hue**: Hue of the wine.
12. **OD280/OD315 of Diluted Wines**: Ratio of absorbance at 280 nm and 315 nm.
13. **Proline**: Proline content.

### Target Variable

The target variable in the dataset is a categorical variable representing the class of wine. There are three classes:

- **Class 1**: Wines derived from the first cultivar.
- **Class 2**: Wines derived from the second cultivar.
- **Class 3**: Wines derived from the third cultivar.

### Data Summary

- **Number of Instances**: 178
- **Number of Features**: 13
- **Number of Classes**: 3
